# Project Description
Image Resizing Program was mainly developed to rescale the pixels, or ratio of an images without scaling the original image quality. This is done by adding an extra image toward the side of the target image, expanding the whole image without interfering the target image. 

Another main purpose for this project is to standardized all the documentation template for my all of my upcoming project which include the following items:

1. README.md
2. SETUP.md
3. CHANGE_LOG.ipynb
4. DEBUG_GUIDE.md
5. BUG_TRACKER.ipynb
6. ...
